# Tinkar Protobuf

This repository contains the Protobuf schema file for the Tinkar project and generates code packages for different
languages that can be distributed to read and write Tinkar files.

## PreRequisites

* Java
* Maven
* C#
* NuGet

## Using Docker to Generate Java and C# Artifacts

To generate Java and C# based objects from the Tinkar.proto file a Docker image will build a JPMS modular jar artifact
file and a .nupkg file.

## Creating the Build containers (if applicable)

To build the proto container, which can be used for file generation. This is used for executing protoc commands. 

```shell
docker build -t tinkar-schema-protoc:latest -f protoc.dockerfile .
```

Similarly, the csharp/mono build container has been created for consistency in executing the csharp commands.

```shell
docker build -t tinkar-schema-csharp:latest -f csharp.dockerfile .
```

## Notes for if you are using a M1 chip

Docker doesn't know how to identify the specific version of the OS because of the virtualization layer on the
processor.  To encourage it to execute the right one, add the following to any build command:

```shell
--platform linux/x86_64
```

## Generate a Source files for Java

If you want to create the java source files, you should something like the following:

```shell
protoc -I <location of current direct> Tinkar.proto --java_out=<target directory>
```

An example of running this and generating the files for your local environment would look something like this:

```shell
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/src:/home/proto-builder/src" protoc sh -c "mkdir -p /home/proto-builder/src/main/java && protoc -I /home/proto-builder/ Tinkar.proto --java_out=/home/proto-builder/src/main/java"
```

## Creating a Java Package

Once you have created the protoc, we can use the following to create a java jar file that will be installed in your 
local maven repository.

```shell
mvn clean install
```

## Using the Java Package

The C-Sharp dll is pushed to Maven Central and can be found at

https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tinkar.ProtoBuf-cs/

To use this dependency in maven, include the following dependency (replacing `${tinkar.version}` with the version that 
you would prefer to use.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.ikm.tinkar</groupId>
    <artifactId>tinkar-schema</artifactId>
    <version>${tinkar.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Generate a Source files for C#

If you want to create the java source files, you should something like the following:

```shell
protoc -I <location of current direct> Tinkar.proto --csharp_out=<target directory>
```

An example of running this and generating the files for your local environment would look something like this:

```shell
docker run -it -v "$(pwd)/code:/home/proto-builder/code" protoc sh -c "mkdir -p /home/proto-builder/code/csharp && protoc -I /home/proto-builder/ Tinkar.proto --csharp_out=/home/proto-builder/code/csharp"
```

## Creating a C# package

To create the C# package, you will restore the installation, then build everything, then package it, 
using the following commands:

```shell
dotnet restore
dotnet build --no-restore
dotnet pack --no-restore --no-build -o /sln/artifacts
```

## Using the Java Package

The C-Sharp dll is pushed to NuGet and can be found at

https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tinkar.Schema/

To install into Visual Studio, type the following into the Nuget console.

```shell
Install-Package Tinkar.Schema
```
